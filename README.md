              ========== GAME DESCRIPTION =========



The Number Guessing Game challenges the player to guess a secret number generated by the computer.
The number lies between 1 and 100, and the player is given 7 chances to guess it correctly.

The game provides hints after every guess:

“Too High” → The guessed number is greater than the target

“Too Low” → The guessed number is smaller than the target

Your goal is to guess the number before your chances run out!



        ======== HOW THE GAME WORKS ===================




1. Start the Game

    When the game begins:

    A random number is generated.

    The number remains hidden from the player.

    You are asked to enter your first guess.

2. Guessing Process

   You type a number (between 1 and 100) and press Enter.

   The game will respond with:

   “Too High!” → if your guess is greater than the secret number

   “Too Low!” → if your guess is less than the secret number

   “Correct!” 🎉 → if your guess matches the number

3. Chances System

   You start with 7 chances.

   Each wrong guess reduces the number of chances
   If chances reach 0, the game ends and you lose.

4. End of Game

   There are two possible results:
   <<< You Win >>>>
   If you guess the correct number.

   A congratulatory message appears.

    <<<< You Lose >>>>>
   If you run out of chances.

   The correct number is revealed.

5. Play Again or Exit

   After the game ends, you can choose:

   Press R → Restart the game

   Press Q → Quit the game

   This makes the program user-friendly and avoids running the code again from the compiler.
